# Lemonade-App
Welcome to Project: Lemonade app!

It is Mobile Application for Kotlin Beginners to learn how to build an app.

The app is built around simplicity, and is organized in a single activity. The different states of the app (whether the user is selecting a lemon, squeezing the lemon, drinking the lemonade, and, finally, the empty glass) are represented by something called a state machine.

The app's state is updated, along with any other needed variables, and then the UI is configured (setting the image and text) separately once all the updates have been made.
